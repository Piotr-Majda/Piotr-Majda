## Projects

### [IP Geolocation API](https://github.com/Piotr-Majda/ip-geolocation-api) - Enterprise-grade RESTful API with Security Focus

A production-ready geolocation service that provides detailed location data for IP addresses and URLs. The API retrieves, stores, and manages geolocation information with built-in resilience against external service and database failures.

**Key Features:**

- **IP & URL Geolocation**: Retrieve detailed location data including country, city, region, coordinates, and timezone
- **Data Persistence**: Store and cache geolocation data to reduce external API calls
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation when external services or database connections fail
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against excessive requests with configurable thresholds
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI

**Engineering Excellence:**

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation of domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- **Test-Driven Development**: 80%+ test coverage across unit, integration, and API tests
- **Security-First Approach**: Automated vulnerability scanning and dependency checking
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-based logging with request tracing and context propagation
- **CI/CD Automation**: Multi-stage pipeline with linting, security scanning, and test verification

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Modern API Development**: FastAPI with OpenAPI documentation and input validation
- **Robust Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with detailed logging
- **Infrastructure Resilience**: Circuit breakers, fallback strategies, and retry mechanisms for external dependencies
- **DevOps Integration**: Docker containerization with multi-environment configuration
- **Code Quality Tooling**: Static analysis, type checking, and automated formatting

### [AI Investment Advisor](https://github.com/Piotr-Majda/advisor-with-rag) - Microservices RAG Platform (In Development phase before MVP)

A sophisticated financial advisory platform leveraging AI to analyze documents and provide intelligent investment insights. Built with a modern microservices approach and advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation.

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Distributed System Implementation**: 5 independent microservices with clear boundaries
- **API Gateway Implementation**: Centralized routing, service discovery, and health monitoring
- **Event-driven Communication**: Real-time processing with WebSockets
- **Advanced RAG Implementation**: Combines document analysis with real-time web data
- **Multi-stage Data Processing**: Document ingestion, vectorization, retrieval, and augmented generation

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Service Isolation**: Each service containerized with independent scaling
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Fully async implementation using FastAPI and WebSockets
- **Vector Search**: Document embeddings with FAISS for semantic retrieval
- **LLM Integration**: Sophisticated prompt engineering with context management
- **Stateless Design**: Cloud-provider independent deployment options

### [AI Tester](https://github.com/Piotr-Majda/ai-tester) CLI tool for Automated Log Analysis & Bug Detection Platform
A developer-focused tool leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze application logs, detect bugs, and generate actionable reports. Designed for extensibility and seamless integration into developer workflows, with a modular AI workflow architecture.

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Modular AI Workflow**: Orchestrated with LangGraph for clear, extensible log parsing, analysis, and report generation.
- **Configurable Log Parsing**: Supports multiple log formats via user-defined regex and structure in YAML config.
- **Structured Output**: Pydantic models ensure stable, type-safe bug reports and analysis results.
- **LLM-Driven Analysis**: Integrates with OpenAI and Ollama for advanced log understanding and anomaly detection.
- **CLI & Extensibility**: Built with Typer for a modern CLI; easily extendable with custom parsers and analyzers.

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Dynamic Log Structure**: Parser adapts to any log format defined in config, supporting rapid onboarding of new log sources.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Core logic decoupled from CLI/web, enabling future API/web integration.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker support for reproducible, environment-agnostic usage.
- **Dependency Management**: Utilizes uv for efficient Python dependency handling.
- **Rich CLI Output**: Optional integration with Rich for enhanced terminal UX.

### [Job Search App](https://github.com/Piotr-Majda/job_search_app) (Proof of concept and prototype)

A web application designed to streamline the job search process using AI for personalized recommendations.

**Key Features:**

- **Automated job scraping** using BeautifulSoup
- **AI-driven recommendations** based on user preferences
- **User-friendly interface** for seamless navigation
