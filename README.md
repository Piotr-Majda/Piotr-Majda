- **Python Frameworks**: FastAPI, asyncio, WebSockets, SQLAlchemy
- **API Development**: RESTful design, OpenAPI specification, Real-time communication
- **Performance**: Rate limiting, Caching strategies, Async programming

### AI & Data Integration

- **LLM Systems**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Prompt engineering, Context management
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, Vector embeddings, Multi-modal data integration
- **Data Processing**: Document parsing, Structured and unstructured data handling

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Databases**: SQL, Redis, Vector databases (FAISS)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Automated testing, Deployment pipelines
- **Cloud-Ready**: Platform-agnostic design, Scalable applications

### Background Experience

- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, RESTful APIs
- **Test Automation**: Selenium, pytest, Test frameworks for embedded systems
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Data extraction and processing

## Projects

### [AI Investment Advisor](https://github.com/Piotr-Majda/advisor-with-rag) - Microservices RAG Platform (In Development phase before MVP)


A sophisticated financial advisory platform leveraging AI to analyze documents and provide intelligent investment insights. Built with a modern microservices approach and advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation.

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Distributed System Implementation**: 5 independent microservices with clear boundaries
- **API Gateway Implementation**: Centralized routing, service discovery, and health monitoring
- **Event-driven Communication**: Real-time processing with WebSockets
- **Advanced RAG Implementation**: Combines document analysis with real-time web data
- **Multi-stage Data Processing**: Document ingestion, vectorization, retrieval, and augmented generation

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Service Isolation**: Each service containerized with independent scaling
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Fully async implementation using FastAPI and WebSockets
- **Vector Search**: Document embeddings with FAISS for semantic retrieval
- **LLM Integration**: Sophisticated prompt engineering with context management
- **Stateless Design**: Cloud-provider independent deployment options

### [Job Search App](https://github.com/Piotr-Majda/job_search_app) (Proof of concept and prototype)

A web application designed to streamline the job search process using AI for personalized recommendations.

**Key Features:**

- **Automated job scraping** using BeautifulSoup
- **AI-driven recommendations** based on user preferences
- **User-friendly interface** for seamless navigation

## Technical Skills & Approaches

- **System Development**: Building maintainable, scalable distributed systems
- **System Integration**: Connecting diverse components into cohesive applications
- **Technical Problem Solving**: Analyzing complex requirements and creating elegant solutions
- **API Implementation**: Creating intuitive, well-documented, and efficient interfaces
